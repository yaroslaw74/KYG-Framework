# lazy_image:
    # By default, images are fetched through "file_get_contents" function, but you can use your own implementation 
    # with an invokable service or a callable.

    # fetch_image_content: 'App\BlurHash\FetchImageContent'

    # It is recommended to cache the generated BlurHash for performance reasons, to avoid generating it for each request.
